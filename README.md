python-book-log

Small exercise for a Python with Data Science course I am taking. The program takes in user input to fill a book log entry, and does various actions such as entering new entries, retrieving instances of the title or author name, retrieving all entries, end program. Plan to better implement CRUD functionality and improve the searching alorgithm to improve runtime.
